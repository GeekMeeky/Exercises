            <p>
                The HyperText Markup Language or <ins>HTML</ins> is the standard markup language for documents designed
                to be
                displayed
                in a
                web browser.It is often assisted by technologies such as <span style="color: white;"> <i>Cascading Style
                        Sheets <sup>(CSS)</sup></i></span> and scripting languages
                such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
                render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                and originally included cues for its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
                With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
                rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
                text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated
                by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into
                the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include
                sub-element tags. Browsers
                do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs
                written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
                The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
                maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
                explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
                audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.

                In 1980, physicist <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> , a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a
                system for
                CERN
                researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
                hypertext
                system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
                Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding,
                but
                the
                project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed <span
                    style="color: white;">"some
                    of the many areas in which hypertext is used";</span> an encyclopedia is the first entry.In 1980,

                Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first
                entry.[4]

                The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned
                on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
                relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by
                SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.
                Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

                HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other
                material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
                defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's
                additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537
                Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that
                used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System)
                operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to
                manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested
                annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup.
                HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

                Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
                Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
                specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly,
                which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six
                months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding
                in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.
                Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993,
                suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
