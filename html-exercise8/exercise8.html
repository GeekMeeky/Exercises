    <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser.It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

    <p style="background-color: white;">
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
        researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year,
        Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the
        project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many
        areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.
