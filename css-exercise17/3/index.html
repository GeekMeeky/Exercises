        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
            XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.The name
            cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one
            declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.Before
            CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font
            colors, background styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described, often
            repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style
            sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML. And additionally, as more and more devices are able to access
            responsive web pages, different screen sizes and layouts begin to appear. Customizing a website for each
            device size is costly and increasingly difficult. The modular nature of CSS means that styles can be reused
            in different parts of a site or even across sites, promoting consistency and efficiency.
