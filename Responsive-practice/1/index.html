                <h3>Saturn</h3>
                <p>
                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
                    It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.It
                    has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.
                    Even though Saturn is nearly the size of Jupiter, Saturn has less than one-third of Jupiter's mass.
                    Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km) with an orbital period of 29.45
                    years.
                    Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic
                    hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer
                    layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical
                    current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic
                    field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to
                    Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[31] The
                    outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast.largest moon and the second largest in
                    the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the
                    planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

                <h3>Moon</h3>
                <p>
                    The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900
                    mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Over time Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking,
                    causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. Because of this, the lunar day and the lunar
                    month are the same length, at 29.5 Earth days. The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser
                    extent, the Sun's are the main drivers of Earth's tides.
                    In geophysical terms the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that
                    of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide
                    as Australia.[17]) Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation
                    to its parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive moon overall, and larger and more massive
                    than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of
                    that of Mars, and the second highest among all Solar System moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. The body
                    of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or
                    magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the
                    debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.
                    The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta,
                    ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains
                    of cooled magma. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The
                    Moon is, beside when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by
                    the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar
                    phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to
                    its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of
                    asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun
                    almost completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible
                    over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the
                    Moon visible.
