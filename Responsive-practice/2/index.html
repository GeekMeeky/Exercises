        <h3>Moon</h3>
        <p>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),
            about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Over time Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking, causing the same
            side of the Moon to always face Earth. Because of this, the lunar day and the lunar month are the same
            length, at 29.5 Earth days. The Moon's gravitational pull and to a lesser extent, the Sun's are the main
            drivers of Earth's tides.
            The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like
            streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of cooled magma.
            These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon is, beside when passing
            through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible
            illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial
            object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the
            lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun,
            allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the
            lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the
            far side of the Moon visible.

        <h3>Saturn</h3>
        <p>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a
            gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth.It has only
            one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.Even though Saturn
            is nearly the size of Jupiter, Saturn has less than one-third of Jupiter's mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a
            distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km) with an orbital period of 29.45 years.
            The planet has a bright and extensive ring system composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of
            rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially
            named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the
            second largest in the Solar System, is larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only
            moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.
            Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and father of Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol
            has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho
            ligature with a horizontal stroke

        <h3>Sky</h3>
        <p>
            The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth. It includes the atmosphere and outer
            space. It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer space.
            In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere,
            concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial
            sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.
            Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and
            usage can vary. An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a
            dome (sometimes called the sky bowl) appearing flatter during the day than at night.
            Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation
            are also visible in the sky. Certain birds and insects, as well as human inventions like aircraft and kites,
            can fly in the sky. Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are
            often seen above large cities.
            In Old English, the term heaven was used to describe the observable expanse above the earth. During the
            period of Middle English, "heaven" began shifting toward its current, religious meaning.
